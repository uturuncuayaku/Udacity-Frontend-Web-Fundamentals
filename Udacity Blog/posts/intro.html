        <p>        <u>AI won't replace the software engineer's job</u> because of the need for understanding and critical thought needed to untangle complexity. Data is simply not as dynamic as the thread of thought connecting it to a solution for a computer to understand, which will require proper communication within the best programming language available for the task or problem.</p>
        <p>This blog will be my personal blog and recollections of the past detailing my previous jobs and personal opinions as I finish my software engineering degree at Southern New Hampshire University. 
        </p>
        <p>I have a one-year old daughter named Amelya and she will most likely make plenty of appearances to the blog. As that is what is most important to me outside of my job at Amazon Logisitics Delivery Center, right now.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for reading, I will also be posting LeetCode solutions for concepts I find difficult to help others along the way. Using mostly C++, Java, Python and/or Go. 
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <p>P.S. Daughter Update:Amelya is crying in her bed because the TV auto shut down. She had mashed potatoes because she is a picky eater as well as learning about scheduling breakfast before daycare and learning how to say goodnight with some tosses on the bed.</p>
