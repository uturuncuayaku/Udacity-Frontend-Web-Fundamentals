### Interface and Architecture 

- Architecture: has appropriate folders and files within to match the folder names and structure of our website.
- Usability: Responsive layout, all features usable across mobile devices, tablets, and modern desktop.
- Styling: Active styling added to navigational links, when scrolling and after clicking each link.
- HTML Structure: Includes four sections and proper modern html5 attributes and elements with consistent naming and dynamic properties added.
### Behaviour 

- Navigation: Navigation is built dynamically using JS with function appendChild, and innerHTML text updated.
- Section Active State: Is clear which section is being viewed.
- Scroll to anchor: When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls the right section.
