<p class="card-description">Llamas have been the largest domesticated animals in South America before Columbus discovered the Americas. They played a major role in the Andean hunter-gatherer societies that make up the herders and farmers of South America. Used as pack animals and protectors of livestock due to their large size in relation to wolves and coyotes. </p>

<p class="card-description">Alpacas are humpless camels, closely related to llamas, and guanacos. They are known for their soft fiber, shorn once or twice a year depending upon its current habitat. There is also a species known as Suri alpaca that have long silky fur that mats into dreadlocks but these pictured above are known as Huacaya. These animals were under my care as a farm hand alongside my father in upstate NY. The animals normally live in mountainous regions at 11,000-16,000 feet above sea level making them characteristically herd animals with long their long necks, short nose, erect ears and soft wool they are built to see across the plains for natural predators like coyotes and wolves.</p>

<p class="card-description"> In computer science, merge sort (also commonly 
	spelled as mergesort and as merge-sort) is an efficient, general-purpose,
	 and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable
	  sort, which means that the relative order of equal elements is the same in the
	   input and output. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that was
	    invented by John von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis
		 of bottom-up merge sort appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as
		  early as 1948.</p>
